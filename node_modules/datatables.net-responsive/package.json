  "readme": "# Responsive for DataTables \n\nThis package contains distribution files for the [Responsive extension](https://datatables.net/extensions/responsive) for [DataTables](https://datatables.net/). Only the core software for this library is contained in this package - to be correctly styled, a styling package for Responsive must also be included. Styling options include DataTable's native styling, [Bootstrap](http://getboostrap.com) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).\n\nIn the modern world of responsive web design tables can often cause a particular problem for designers due to their row based layout. Responsive is an extension for DataTables that resolves that problem by optimising the table's layout for different screen sizes through the dynamic insertion and removal of columns from the table.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Browser\n\nFor inclusion of this library using a standard `<script>` tag, rather than using this package, it is recommended that you use the [DataTables download builder](//datatables.net/download) which can create CDN or locally hosted packages for you, will all dependencies satisfied.\n\n### npm\n\n```\nnpm install datatables.net-responsive\n```\n\n```\nvar $ = require( 'jquery' );\nrequire( 'datatables.net-responsive' )( window, $ );\n```\n\n### bower\n\n```\nbower install --save datatables.net-responsive\n```\n\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation of the DataTables options, API and plug-in interface are available on the DOCS_LINK. The site also contains information on the wide variety of plug-ins that are available for DataTables, which can be used to enhance and customise your table even further.\n\n\n## Bug / Support\n\nSupport for DataTables is available through the [DataTables forums](//datatables.net/forums) and [commercial support options](//datatables.net/support) are available.\n\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you are thinking of contributing code to DataTables, first of all, thank you!
